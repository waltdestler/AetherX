# AetherX Physics Engine

Box2D is the foundational physics engine, which was then ported to C# as Farseer and evolved independently. Farseer is now abandoned and lives on in Aether.Physics2D, which is still maintained as of Dec 2018. This is a fork of Aether.Physics2D which is enhanced to include further optimizations specifically for many-fixtured bodies in a huge, expansive world.


# Added Features

**Per-Body Broadphase AABB Prior to Fixture AABB Test**
* Greatly reduces collision detection time for bodies containing more than one fixture.
* PR: https://github.com/alundgren04/AetherX/pull/4

**Ability to load a R.U.B.E. (Really Useful Box2D Editor) world via JSON.**

**Additional test bed cases (MaxBodyTest) to benchmark performance of very large worlds.**


# Existing Features

The below items are all inherited from the original repo at: https://github.com/tainicom/Aether.Physics2D
* Continuous collision detection (with time of impact solver)
* Contact callbacks: begin, end, pre-solve, post-solve
* Convex and concave polyons and circles.
* Multiple shapes per body
* Dynamic tree and quad tree broadphase
* Fast broadphase AABB queries and raycasts
* Collision groups and categories
* Sleep management
* Friction and restitution
* Stable stacking with a linear-time solver
* Revolute, prismatic, distance, pulley, gear, mouse joint, and other joint types
* Joint limits and joint motors
* Controllers (gravity, force generators)
* Tools to decompose concave polygons, find convex hulls and boolean operations
* Factories to simplify the creation of bodies
* Fluid dynamics

# Feature Roadmap / Proposals

**Improved diagnostics**
* Record the "ticks" at the time each AABB is tested for collision, so the DebugView may highlight their rendering accordingly. This will help ensure there is no unneccesary processing. For example, ensuring a fixture AABB isn't ever compared unless the body AABB has collided.
* Any time AABB is recalculated, record "tick" time. In DebugView, highlight if it happened recently. Goal: low # highlights.

**Collision Optimizations**
* Only calculate and populate the fixture AABB tree for a given body if the body AABB is colliding. Otherwise, it shouldn't be needed at all. If the body AABB calculation has a dependency on the fixtureAABBs, then perhaps it calculates once and rotates as needed, or even uses a simple radius check.

* Only do collision tests for bodies which already have their body AABB collided or have had their bady AABB recalculated/moved. Otherwise, there should be no need. Moving bodies will test for collisions. Bodies which haven't moved don't need to test.

* Tighten up the CircleShape AABB. Currently it's factoring in rotation in a way which seems wrong. Needs more investigation.

* Tighten up the body AABBs, as they seem to have a margin beyond the fixture AABBs. I believe they should match the outer extents of the body's fixture AABBs with no additional margin/fattening.

* If a body only has one fixture, then don't calc/store fixture AABBs and if the body AABB collides, count it as that single fixture colliding.

* Offload bodies which haven't collided recently and which aren't near an "interest area" to a shadow World object, where they may be "hibernated"  until needed. More to come on this.

* Rename the project to aid discoverability. Search combinations of "Aether" and "Physics" yields a massive amount of search results which are unrelated. Perhaps revert back to a name closer to a term users may be searching for, such as "Box2D" or "Farseer." Perhaps "Farseer 2" or "Sharp Box2D."
